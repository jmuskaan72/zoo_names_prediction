# zoo_names_prediction
A zoo hosts a set of animals that can co-exist in an environment.
Given a set of 101 animals associated with 7 types of zoo, with a feature vector containing 17 values (15 bool,2 integers)
describing each animal.

#GOAL

To design a Machine Learning algorithm for finding the zoo for every animal,
given set of features for the animal using Support Vector Machine(SVM).
